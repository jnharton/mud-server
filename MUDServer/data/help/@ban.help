@BAN

Ban a player you specify. This is an ip address ban which doubles as an account
suspending command.

NOTE: Currently the player needs to be connected.

Syntax: @ban <player name>     -- ban a player
        @ban #ip <address>     -- ban an IP address
        @ban #list             -- list banned players and ip addresses.
        @ban +ip <player name> -- ban a player and their current IP address
