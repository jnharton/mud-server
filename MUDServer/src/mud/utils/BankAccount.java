 * BankAccount
 * 
 * A class designed to represent a simple bank account
 * which has an id number, and stored numbers representing
 * money in the bank.
 * 
 * NOTE: This design is this way because it is intended for use
 * in the MUDServer and thusly represents real midieval-esque
 * money which could be reduced to a single denomination representation,
 * but is not because it would necessitate a translation step between
 * the actual money the player has and the way it's stored in the bank.
 * That is not desired, and is thus avoided.
